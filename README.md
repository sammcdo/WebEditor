# WebEditor
A basic html editor written in python.

I used it to learn some html. The main features I wanted were a hexadecimal color picker and 
code bits so I didn't have to remember all the html tags. I implemented basic versions of both those features
and it was great!

It contains a modified version of scrolledText.py from the book 
[Python Programming 4th Edition](https://learning-python.com/about-pp4e.html)
